**Road Plan**

- Build a MISP-like very simple virtual machine
- Build an assembler
- Build a compiler for a Go-like language
- Reimplement all the above in Javascript
- Build an online platform where people can submit interfaces, test cases, and implementations
- Test cases works like executables, linking with other implementation modules.
- Interfaces and implementations are general library modules
- Can only access other modules via publicly defined interfaces, methods, functions, types, consts
- This is just for single vm open source testing
- For more complex stuff, we can have multiple vm testing, where all calls are performed over network RPC calls
