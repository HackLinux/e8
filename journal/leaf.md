# A sample stay program

- each file is a package, the filename is the package name
- no need to claim package name
- every package that has a main function can be launched from the command line
- every package that has *Test(t testing.T) functions can be launched as test cases
- function can only return single value

import (
    "u/h8liu/react"
    "p/react/sim"
    "g/google/spdy"
)

func main() {
          
}
